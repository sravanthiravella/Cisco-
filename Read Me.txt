1. Firstly, I have signed up for an account in macaddress.io to get the API key for mac address lookup.

2. I have written python code to call the API token and output the program with the Vendor name of the Mac.

3. I have downloaded docker on my Mac, Created the docker file and using the Python official image from Docker hub I have created an image called sravanthi123 to execute the python and successfully ran on mac. 

Commands used for docker :

1. mkdir DockerFiles
2. vim dockerfile
3. docker build -t sravanthi123 .
4. docker images
5. docker run "imageid"

I have uploaded the program code and docker file to Github
